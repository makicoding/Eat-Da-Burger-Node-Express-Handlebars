# Eat-Da-Burger-Node-Express-Handlebars


Eat-Da-Burger is a burger logger using Node, Express, MySQL, Handlebars and an ORM.

A user can create and add a burger name in the input box. Once the "Add Burger" button is clicked, the burger is added to the MySQL database and appears on the HTML page burger list as a button.  

Once the HTML button for the new burger is clicked, this will update the database "devoured" boolean column from false (0) to true (1).
